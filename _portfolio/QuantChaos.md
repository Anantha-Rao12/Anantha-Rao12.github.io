QuantChaos is a set of scripts and tools that can help one get acquainted with studying quantum systems like the quantum kicked rotor whose classical analogues exhibit senstive dependence to initial conditions, i.e chaos. A trajectory based definition of chaos breaks down in the quantum world and neccissitates a more refined definition of chaotic behavior. In QuantChaos, we motivate and develop tools such as the Lockshmidt Echo and Out-of-Time-ordered Correlator that are *opined* to be measures of chaos in such quantum systems at certain limits. 

The quantum kicked rotor is a very exciting system where one can study diverse phenomena like Anderson localization originally seen in the disordered electronic systems and continuous-time quantum walks.
