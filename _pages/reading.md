### Textbooks on Quantum Theory
1. Neilson and Chuang (USA, India) - The OG textbook for consolidating everything basic about quantum information science
2. Griffith's Quantum Mechanics (USA, India) - The classic textbook was starting your study of quantum mechanics (the physics way!)
3. Sakurai Quantum Mechanics (USA, India) - Graduate level textbook for quantum mechanics. 

### Non-fiction Science
1. Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything (US, India) - The book which inspired me to take science in high school.
2. Stephen Hawking's A Brief History Of Time (US, India) - Inspiring classic that introduced me to some undergraduate physics in high school.


### Non-fiction
1. James Clear's Atomic Habits (US, India) - A practical book on how to develop good habits and undo bad ones. 
2. Dale Carnegie's How to make friends and influence people (US, India) - A practical book on building relationships in the business world (seems a bit outdated for today)
