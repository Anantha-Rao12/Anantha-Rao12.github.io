Books that I have read, reading, and a wishlist that I would like to read. Recos are always welcome! 


### Popular Science 🌎

1. *A Short History of Nearly Everything* by Bill Bryson: Book which single-handedly inspired me to study science in high school and win a science competiton.
2. *A Brief History Of Time* by Stephen Hawking: Inspiring classic that introduced me to undergraduate physics in high school.

### Non-fiction 📖

1. *Atomic Habits* by James Clear: A practical book on how to develop good habits and undo bad ones. 
2. *How to make friends and influence people* by Dale Carnegie: A practical book on building relationships in the business world (seems a bit outdated for today). 
3. *How to Win at College* by Cal Newport: A must-read practical guide for every undergrad written by one of my favorite authors.
4. *How to become a Straight-A student* by Cal Newport: A distillation of the top traits of high academic achievers with many useful ideas.

### Physics textbooks 📚⚛️

1. *Quantum computation and quantum information* by Neilson and Chuang: The OG textbook for consolidating everything basic about quantum information science. 
2. *Introductory Quantum Mechanics* by Griffiths (3ed): The classic textbook for starting your study of quantum mechanics (the physics way!). 
3. *Advanced Quantum Mechanics* by Sakurai: Graduate level textbook for quantum mechanics. 
4. *Solid State physics* by Ashcroft and Merwin: Standard textbook for condensed matter physics. Very solid on the basics and something I always go back to revise. 

### Misc 🌈
