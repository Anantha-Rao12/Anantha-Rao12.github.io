This page is a compilation of advice that I have found useful or have been recommended. I  write about my experience as an undergrad and how I would learn from on <a href="https://anantharao.substack.com/" target="_blank">substack</a>. 

### Research 

1.  Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg penned <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/426389a" target="_blank"> four golden lessons </a> for students at the start of their scientific careers : (1) Start doing research early and learn as you go. (2) Go for the messy problems where creative work can be done. (3) Forgive yourself for wasting time on unsolvable or unimportant problems. (4) Enjoy what you are doing and learn from the history of science.
