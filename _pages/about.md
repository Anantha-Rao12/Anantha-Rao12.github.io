- I am a 3rd year BS-MS student, majoring in Physics (with a minor in Data Science) at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune ([IISER Pune](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/)), India. 
- I am currently working on understanding electronic and quantum phase transitions at low temperatures using machine learning, under the supervision of by [Prof.Brad Marston](https://sites.brown.edu/bradmarston/) and [Dr.Stephen Carr](https://sites.google.com/view/stcarr/) at Brown University. 
- I am also a Research Intern working with [Prof MS Santhanam](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/) at IISER Pune on many-body localization and information scrambling in quantum chaotic systems.
- My Career Objective is quite simple: “Follow my heart, spread my love for Science, and finally, do good for the world and posterity.” 
- My research interests are primarily in the subjects of Quantum Information, Quantum Computing, Data Science, Machine Learning, Computational Modelling and Simulation.
