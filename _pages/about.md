I'm currently a 3rd year BS-MS student, majoring in Physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune ([IISER Pune](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/)). My research interests are mainly in the subjects of Quantum Information, Quantum Computing, Data Science, Machine Learning, Computational Modelling and Simulation. Lately I have also been amazed by some beautiful cold-atoms experiments. 
My Career Objective is quite simple: “Follow my heart, spread my love for Science, and finally, do good for the world and our posterity.” 
I enjoy solving complex problems by using the knowledge and skills from the diverse disciplines of Fundamental and Applied sciences.
