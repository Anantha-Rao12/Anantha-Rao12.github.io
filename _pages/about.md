## For Academics
  I am currently a 5th-year undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), India, majoring in physics, focussing particularly on quantum information theory. I will be joining the <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu" target="_blank">Physics department of UMD</a> in Fall 2023 to conduct research on novel quantum algorithms. The current landscape of noisy quantum devices requires the development of robust hardware, noise-friendly algorithms, and error-correcting schemes. My research interest is in developing novel quantum algorithms/protocols that can overcome the challenges of such noisy quantum devices. The interplay of physics and engineering in controlling quantum systems and building practical applications in quantum sensing and computing drives me as a scientist.

## For Non-academics
  Hi, I am a Physicist (in training) who studies tiny things at very low temperatures. I am an incoming graduate student at the <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu" target="_blank">Physics department at the University of Maryland (UMD)</a> from 2023. That means, I will be working towards a doctorate degree in physics at UMD. I enjoy participating in quantum hackathons, seminars and solving problems by pen or code. Besides research, I like exploring quaint corners in cities like Pune or Bangalore, where I can take photos, try street food and learn about history. I also enjoy reading non-fiction books and hiking the western ghats. You can find more on the above alluded topics in this digital space.

Welcome!

## Interests and Research 
- Broad research interests: Quantum information, Quantum algorithms, Condensed matter physics, Machine learning.
- Currently, I am working with IBM Research on designing new variational quantum algorithms to probe for computational advantages in [generative machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model). 
- At IISER Pune, I continue to work with <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">Prof MS Santhanam</a>. We've previously looked at problems from many-body localization and information scrambling in quantum chaotic systems. Now, I'm developing novel quantum search algorithms using the quantum kicked rotor as a model. 
- In 2021, I was the cofounding member and lead the software team of the first student-led startup <a href="https://curembiotech.com/" target="_blank">Curem Biotech</a>, at IISER Pune.
- I am an avid supporter of FOSS (Free and Open source software) and have also contributed to various open source organizations (Julia, iGEM and ML4SCI) 
 

I play the guitar, read non-fiction books and write blog posts about science. I've lately been gardening but haven't been very good at that. I believe in "Learning everyday and contributing to the society". Thank you for staying by. Goodspeed.
