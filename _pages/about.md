  I am a 5th-year undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), India, majoring in physics, focussing particularly on quantum information theory and condensed matter physics. The current landscape of noisy quantum devices requires the development of robust hardware, noise-friendly algorithms, and error-correcting schemes. The prospect of symbiotically combining physics and engineering to control such many-body quantum systems and building practical applications in quantum sensing and computing drives me as a scientist. In addition, the study of exotic materials like graphene and atomically thin semiconductors through ab-initio simulations and statistical methods interest me.

Welcome!

## Interests and Research 
- Broad research interests: Quantum information, Quantum algorithms, Condensed matter physics, Machine learning.
- Currently, I am working with IBM Research on designing new variational quantum algorithms to probe for computational advantages in [generative machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model). 
- At IISER Pune, I continue to work with <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">Prof MS Santhanam</a>. We've previously looked at problems from many-body localization and information scrambling in quantum chaotic systems. Now, I'm developing novel quantum search algorithms using the quantum kicked rotor as a model. 
- In 2021, I was the cofounding member and lead the software team of the first student-led startup <a href="https://curembiotech.com/" target="_blank">Curem Biotech</a>, at IISER Pune.
- I am an avid supporter of FOSS (Free and Open source software) and have also contributed to various open source organizations (Julia, iGEM and ML4SCI) 
 

I play the guitar, read non-fiction books and write blog posts about science. I've lately been gardening but haven't been very good at that. I believe in "Learning everyday and contributing to the society". Thank you for staying by. Goodspeed.
