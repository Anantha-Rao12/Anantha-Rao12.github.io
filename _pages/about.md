Greetings! My name is Anantha (Ananth). I am a Physicist (in training), who loves quantum physics and computers. I am currently a final year master's student at [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), and I will be joining the <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu" target="_blank">Physics department</a> at the University of Maryland (College Park) in Fall 2023 as a graduate student.
  
You can find my research summary <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anantha-Rao12/Anantha-Rao12.github.io/master/files/AnanthaRao-WorkSummary.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and my curriculum vitae (updated Feb 2023) <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anantha-Rao12/Anantha-Rao12.github.io/master/files/AnanthaRao_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

This website is a place where I share my interests, and insights on various topics. 

Welcome!

## Research interests
- Broad research interests: Quantum information, Quantum algorithms, Condensed matter physics, Machine learning and deep learning.
- During my master's thesis, I worked with IBM Research on developing new variational quantum algorithms for [generative machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model).  
- At IISER Pune, I work with <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">Prof MS Santhanam</a> on various problems related to quantum chaos, many-body localization, and quantum search algorithms. 
- In 2021, I co-founded and led the software team of <a href=“https://curembiotech.com/” target=“_blank”>Curem Biotech</a>, the first student-led startup at IISER Pune.
- I am an avid supporter of FOSS (Free and Open source software) and have also contributed to various open source organizations (Julia, iGEM and ML4SCI) 

## Other interests
- Hackathons (quantum/classical), seminars on trends in academia+industry and problem-solving sessions are some of the events that interest me.
- Exploring new places🧭, photographing sights📷, trying diverse cuisines 🍱🍚 and learning about history are some of the hobbies that I pursue.
- Reading books 📚 (mostly non-fiction) and writing blog posts ✍️ about science are some of the ways that I learn and communicate.
- Playing the guitar 🎸 and hiking the western ghats 🥾⛰ are some of the activities that I enjoy.
- Gardening 🌳 is something that I’ve recently started but I’m not very good at it yet.

## Pet projects

## Misc 
- I like and use <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114317125-anantha-rao" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> for keeping track of reading lists.
- I used quora before but abandoned it after aggressive paywalls.
