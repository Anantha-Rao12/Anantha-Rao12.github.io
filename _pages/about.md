- I am currently a 3rd year BS-MS student, majoring in Physics (minor in Data Science) at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune ([IISER Pune](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/)). 
- My research interests are mainly in the subjects of Quantum Information, Quantum Computing, Data Science, Machine Learning, Computational Modelling and Simulation. Lately I have also been marveled by some beautiful cold-atoms experiments and simulations.
- My Career Objective is quite simple: “Follow my heart, spread my love for Science, and finally, do good for the world and posterity.”
