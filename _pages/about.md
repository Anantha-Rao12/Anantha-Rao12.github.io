Hi there!

I'm Ananth, a 4th year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune, India, majoring in physics with a minor in data science. I am broadly interested in studying quantum-mechanical systems and solving problems from quantum information theory, quantum computing, and condensed matter physics using theoretical and computational tools. To this end, I have just enough knowledge in computer science and data science and intend to leverage the data revolution and contribute to the ongoing *quantum revolution*.

Welcome!

## My work and Research 
- Broad Research interests: Quantum chaos, Quantum computing, Quantum algorithms, Machine learning.
- Currently, I work as a research intern with [Prof MS Santhanam](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/) at IISER Pune. We've previously looked at problems from many-body localization and information scrambling in quantum chaotic systems. Now, I'm developing novel quantum search algorithms using the quantum kicked rotor as a model. 
- In the summer of 2021, I studied electronic and quantum phase transitions at low temperatures under the supervision of by [Prof.Brad Marston](https://sites.brown.edu/bradmarston/) and [Dr.Stephen Carr](https://sites.google.com/view/stcarr/) at Brown University. The broader project is a part of Google Summer of Code 2021 under the ML4SCI organization. We created an open source application to process, extract feature, and identify quantum phases using machine learning. 
- In 2021, I was the cofounding member and lead the software team of the first student-led startup [Curem Biotech](https://curembiotech.com/), at IISER Pune.
- I am an avid supporter of FOSS (Free and Open source software) and have also contributed to various open source organizations (Julia, iGEM and ML4SCI) 
- You can find a more succinct version of my research summary in [this](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url={https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anantha-Rao12/Anantha-Rao12.github.io/master/assets/Arao-WorkSummary-presentation.pdf}) small presentation. 
 
## Career Highlights

- Masters thesis student at IBM Research (incoming 2022-23)
- Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Student Developer : 2021
- National Graduate Physics Examination (NGPE) : 2nd in the state Maharasthra,  Top 2% in the country. 
- IGEM IISER Pune Software and Modeling Team Leader : 2020 (Gold Medal and Jury's Best project award)
- Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) Research Scholar recognized by the Government of India (2018-2023)

I play the guitar, read non-fiction books and write blog posts about science! I've lately been gardening a lot but haven't been very good at that. I believe in "Learning everyday and contributing to the society". Thank you for staying by. Goodspeed.
