I am a 5th-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune, India, majoring in physics, focussing particularly on quantum information theory and condensed matter physics. I am broadly interested in understanding the behavior of strongly-correlated systems quantum manybody systems through semi-analytical and computational approaches. The current landscape of noisy quantum devices for sensing and computing requires the development of new methods to understand and harness their properties. I am interested to work on the theory of such quantum devices, their limitations, and harnessing their power for practical applications.

You can find a more succinct version of my research summary in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anantha-Rao12/Anantha-Rao12.github.io/master/assets/Arao-WorkSummary-presentation.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> small presentation.

Welcome!

## Work and Research 
- Broad Research interests: Quantum information, Quantum algorithms, Condensed matter physics, Machine learning.
- Currently, I am wroking with IBM Research on designing new variational quantum algorithms to probe for computational advantages in [generative machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model). 
- At IISER Pune, I continue to work with <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">Prof MS Santhanam</a> We've previously looked at problems from many-body localization and information scrambling in quantum chaotic systems. Now, I'm developing novel quantum search algorithms using the quantum kicked rotor as a model. 
- In 2021, I was the cofounding member and lead the software team of the first student-led startup <a href="https://curembiotech.com/" target="_blank">Curem Biotech</a>, at IISER Pune.
- I am an avid supporter of FOSS (Free and Open source software) and have also contributed to various open source organizations (Julia, iGEM and ML4SCI) 
 
## Career Highlights

- National Graduate Physics Examination (NGPE) : 2nd in the state Maharasthra, Top 2% in the country. 
- IGEM IISER Pune Software and Modeling Team Leader : 2020 (Gold Medal and Jury's Best project award)
- Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) Research Scholar recognized by the Government of India (2018-2023)

I play the guitar, read non-fiction books and write blog posts about science! I've lately been gardening a lot but haven't been very good at that. I believe in "Learning everyday and contributing to the society". Thank you for staying by. Goodspeed.
