Hi! I'm Ananth, a 4th year BS-MS student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune, India, majoring in Physics at the [Department of Physics](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/) with a Data Science minor. I am have a Physicist (in training) primarily interested to work in the area of quantum inforamtion theory, quantum computing, and condensed matter physics but I have just enough knowledge in computer science and data science to make trouble. My research, motivation and broader service are all grounded in the idea to “Follow my heart, spread my love for Science, and finally, do good for the world and posterity.” 


## My work and Research 
- I am currently trying to understand electronic and quantum phase transitions at low temperatures using machine learning, under the supervision of by [Prof.Brad Marston](https://sites.brown.edu/bradmarston/) and [Dr.Stephen Carr](https://sites.google.com/view/stcarr/) at Brown University. The  broader project is a part of Google Summer of Code 2021, ML4SCI organization.  
- I lead the technical group of a new biotech-AI startup [Curem Biotech](https://curembiotech.com/)! 
- Previously, I worked as a Research Intern working with [Prof MS Santhanam](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/) at IISER Pune on many-body localization and information scrambling in quantum chaotic systems.
- My research interests are primarily in the subjects of Quantum Information, Quantum Computing, Data Science, Machine Learning, Computational Modelling and Simulation.
- I am a supporter of FOSS (Free and Open source software) and have also contributed to various open source organizations (Julia, iGEM and ML4SCI) 
 
## Career Highlights

- Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Student Developer : 2021
- National Graduate Physics Examination (NGPE) : 2nd in the state Maharasthra,  Top 2% in the country. 
- IGEM IISER Pune Software and Modeling Team Leader : 2020 (Gold Medal adn Jury's Best project award)
- Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) Research Scholar recognized by the Government of India (2018-2023)

I play the guitar, read non-fiction books and write blog posts about science! I've lately been gardening a lot but haven't been very good at that. I believe in "Learning everyday and contributing to the society". Thank you for staying by. Goodspeed.
