Greetings! My name is Anantha (*pronounced : An-an-tha*, *Kannada*: ‡≤Ö‡≤®‡≤Ç‡≤§, *Hindi*: ‡§Ö‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§§). I am a first-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu" target="_blank">UMD Physics</a> and <a href="https://quics.umd.edu/" target="_blank">QuICS</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://quics.umd.edu/people/michael-gullans" target="_blank">Michael Gullans</a>. I also closely work with Prof. <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/justyna-zwolak" target="_blank">Justyna Zwolak</a> at NIST, Prof. <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">M. S. Santhanam</a> at IISER Pune and the IBM-Quantum Research team in India. I received my BS-MS Physics from <a href="https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/" target="_blank">IISER Pune</a>.  

My research area is the intersection of Quantum Information and Condensed Matter Physics. My research aims to study many-body quantum systems, understand their behaviour, and harness their non-classical properties to build useful, scalable devices for practical applications. To this end, I utilize and develop analytical, numerical and statistical methods. Some of the projects I am currently working on are : 


- Quantum algorithms with repeated measurements and Post-selection.
- One-dimensional manybody quantum systems in the presence of disorder.
- Automated autotuning approaches for quantum-dot devices.
- Quantum-enhanced machine learning and tensor-networks. 

This website is a place where I share my interests, learnings and insights on various topics. If you are interested in my CV (updated Nov 2023) <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anantha-Rao12/Anantha-Rao12.github.io/master/files/AnanthaRao_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> it is!


Welcome!

## Research interests
- Broad research interests: Quantum information, Quantum algorithms, Condensed matter physics, Machine learning and deep learning.
- During my master's thesis, I worked with IBM Research on developing new variational quantum algorithms for [generative machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model).  
- At IISER Pune, I worked with <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">Prof MS Santhanam</a> on various problems related to quantum chaos, many-body localization, and quantum search algorithms. 
- In 2021, I co-founded and led the software team of <a href="https://curembiotech.com/" target="_blank">Curem Biotech</a>, the first student-led startup at IISER Pune.
- An avid supporter of FOSS (Free and Open source software), I also write-code for various open source organizations (Julia, iGEM and ML4SCI) 

## Other interests
- Hackathons (quantum/classical), seminars on trends in academia+industry.
- Exploring new placesüß≠, photographing sightsüì∑, trying diverse cuisines üç±üçö and learning about history are some of the hobbies that I pursue.
- Reading books üìö (mostly non-fiction) and writing blog posts ‚úçÔ∏è about science are some of the ways that I learn and communicate.
- Playing the guitar üé∏ and hiking the western ghats ü•æ‚õ∞ are some of the activities that I enjoy.
- Gardening üå≥ is something that I‚Äôve recently started but I‚Äôm not very good at it yet.
