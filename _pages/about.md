My name is Anantha Rao. (*pronounced : An-an-tha*, *Kannada*: ಅನಂತ; meaning : *infinity*). 

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu" target="_blank">UMD Physics</a> and <a href="https://quics.umd.edu/" target="_blank">QuICS</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://quics.umd.edu/people/michael-gullans" target="_blank">Michael Gullans</a>. I also closely work with Prof. <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/justyna-zwolak" target="_blank">Justyna Zwolak</a> at NIST. Previously, I received my BS-MS (Physics) from <a href="https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/" target="_blank">IISER Pune</a>, India, working with Prof. <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">M. S. Santhanam</a> and the IBM-Quantum Research team.   

My research interests lie in the intersection of Quantum Information and Condensed Matter Physics. My research aims to study many-body quantum systems, understand their behavior, and harness their non-classical properties to build useful, scalable devices for practical applications. To this end, I employ and develop analytical, numerical, and statistical approaches. Some of the current research projects are: 

- Manybody interacting hybrid systems and with dynamic feedback.
- Semiconductor quantum dot devices (device theory, shuttling quantum information between processors, and automation of experiments).
- Characterization, Verification, and Validation of quantum-information processing devices (QCVV)
- Machine learning (Quantum-enhanced and Classical) and tensor networks. 

I share my interests, cool thoughts, and insights on various topics on this website. A lot of things that I gain from my research do not end up being part of the final research papers I write, but I would be very happy to talk to and learn from the research audience. I strongly believe in science being a collective and collaborative effort, and I look forward to discussing ideas.

If you are interested in my CV (updated Nov 2024) <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anantha-Rao12/Anantha-Rao12.github.io/master/files/AnanthaRao_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> it is!

## Research Highlights
- MAViS is out! Submitted to Physical Review X (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12516" target="_blank">arxiv2411.12516</a>) .
- Invited to talk at Silicon Quantum Electronics (SIQEW) 2024. 
- Conducted a tutorial on learning electron configurations through NMR spectroscopy with machine learning at Brown AI Winter school (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmrNGed_Mwo" target="_blank">YT link</a>). 
- During my master's thesis, I worked with IBM Research on developing new variational quantum algorithms for [generative machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model). 
- At IISER Pune, I worked with <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">Prof MS Santhanam</a> on various problems related to quantum chaos, many-body localization, and quantum search algorithms. 
- In 2021, I co-founded and led the software team of <a href="https://curembiotech.com/" target="_blank">Curem Biotech</a>, the first student-led startup at IISER Pune (We raised over $50k).
- An avid supporter of FOSS (Free and Open source software), I also write code for various open-source organizations (Julia, iGEM, and ML4SCI)
