Hi there!

I'm Anantha. I am a 5th-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune, India. I am majoring in theoretical physics, focussing particularly on quantum information theory and condensed matter physics, with a minor in data science. I am broadly interested in understanding the behavior of quantum materials and processes through theoretical and computational methods. The current landscape of noisy quantum devices for sensing and computing requires the development of new methods to understand their dynamic properties and design novel algorithms that can exhibit a quantum advantage. I am interested to work on the theory of such quantum devices, their limitations, and harnessing their power to design novel algorithms.

Welcome!

## My work and Research 
- Broad Research interests: Quantum chaos, Quantum computing, Quantum algorithms, Machine learning.
- Currently, I work as a research intern with <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">Prof MS Santhanam</a> at IISER Pune. We've previously looked at problems from many-body localization and information scrambling in quantum chaotic systems. Now, I'm developing novel quantum search algorithms using the quantum kicked rotor as a model. 
- In the summer of 2021, I studied electronic and quantum phase transitions at low temperatures under the supervision of by <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/bradmarston/" target="_blank">Prof.Brad Marston</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/stcarr/" target="_blank">Dr.Stephen Carr</a> at Brown University. The broader project is a part of Google Summer of Code 2021 under the ML4SCI organization. We created an open source application to process, extract feature, and identify quantum phases using machine learning. 
- In 2021, I was the cofounding member and lead the software team of the first student-led startup <a href="https://curembiotech.com/" target="_blank">Curem Biotech</a>, at IISER Pune.
- I am an avid supporter of FOSS (Free and Open source software) and have also contributed to various open source organizations (Julia, iGEM and ML4SCI) 
- You can find a more succinct version of my research summary in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anantha-Rao12/Anantha-Rao12.github.io/master/assets/Arao-WorkSummary-presentation.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> small presentation.

I play the guitar, read non-fiction books and write blog posts about science! I've lately been gardening a lot but haven't been very good at that. I believe in "Learning everyday and contributing to the society". Thank you for staying by. Goodspeed.
