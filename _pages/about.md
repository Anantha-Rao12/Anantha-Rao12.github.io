## For Academics
  I am currently a 5th-year undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), India, majoring in physics, focussing particularly on quantum information theory. I will be joining the <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu" target="_blank">Physics department of UMD</a> in Fall 2023 to conduct research on novel quantum algorithms. The current landscape of noisy quantum devices requires the development of robust hardware, noise-friendly algorithms, and error-correcting schemes. The prospect of symbiotically combining physics and engineering to control many-body quantum systems and building practical applications in quantum sensing and computing drives me as a scientist.

## For Non-academics
  Hi, I am a Physicist (in training), studying things at the atomic scale at very low temperatures. I am incoming graduate student at the <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu" target="_blank">Physics department at the University of Maryland (UMD)</a>. That means, I will be pursuing a Doctrate degree in Physics at UMD, starting 2023. I usually participate in most quantum hackathons and admire computational thinking. Apart from research, I like exploring new, quaint corners amidst a busy-city life in Pune, and in Bangalore which include: historic photography, snacking on street food. I also read non-fiction books and trek occasionally. You can find some more details on the above alluded topics in this digital space.

Welcome!

## Interests and Research 
- Broad research interests: Quantum information, Quantum algorithms, Condensed matter physics, Machine learning.
- Currently, I am working with IBM Research on designing new variational quantum algorithms to probe for computational advantages in [generative machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model). 
- At IISER Pune, I continue to work with <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">Prof MS Santhanam</a>. We've previously looked at problems from many-body localization and information scrambling in quantum chaotic systems. Now, I'm developing novel quantum search algorithms using the quantum kicked rotor as a model. 
- In 2021, I was the cofounding member and lead the software team of the first student-led startup <a href="https://curembiotech.com/" target="_blank">Curem Biotech</a>, at IISER Pune.
- I am an avid supporter of FOSS (Free and Open source software) and have also contributed to various open source organizations (Julia, iGEM and ML4SCI) 
 

I play the guitar, read non-fiction books and write blog posts about science. I've lately been gardening but haven't been very good at that. I believe in "Learning everyday and contributing to the society". Thank you for staying by. Goodspeed.
